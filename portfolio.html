 Reflection: The purpose of the game is to get the main character to defeat the aliens. The player can use the right and left keys 
 and eventually get to the last level where the opponent becomes more challenging. From completing this game I was able to become 
 better acquainted with the programming language of Scratch. I encountered several difficulties and often had to debug my code. 
 The primary struggles came from attemtipng to use "broadcast" as well as figuring out what code fit with what. Through the problems
 I encountered I was able to do some research and eventually program the game the way I envisioned. Overall, creating this scratch game
 was challenging but entertaining.

<h5>Python Image Artist Project: </h5>

 Reflection: The purpose of our python project was to alter an image and place it behind a different background. The background of the 
 image would have to be a white background and our program will locate those white pixels to convert them into transparent pixels. The
 transparent photo is then placed over the a different chosen background.
