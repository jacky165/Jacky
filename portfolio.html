Reflection: The purpose of the game is to get the main character to defeat the aliens. The player can use the right and left keys 
and eventually get to the last level where the opponent becomes more challenging. From completing this game I was able to become 
better acquainted with the programming language of Scratch. I encountered several difficulties and often had to debug my code. 
The primary struggles came from attemtipng to use "broadcast" as well as figuring out what code fit with what. Through the problems
I encountered I was able to do some research and eventually program the game the way I envisioned. Overall, creating this scratch game
was challenging but entertaining.
