 Reflection: The purpose of the game is to get the main character to defeat the
 aliens. The player can use the right and left keys and eventually get to the last
 level where the opponent becomes more challenging. From completing this game I was 
 able to become better acquainted with the programming language of Scratch. I 
 encountered several difficulties and often had to debug my code. The primary struggles
 came from attempting to use "broadcast" as well as figuring out what code fit with 
 what. Through the problems I encountered I was able to do some research and eventually
 program the game the way I envisioned. Overall, creating this scratch game was 
 challenging but entertaining.
