 Reflection: The purpose of our code was to manipulate an image to alter the opacity
 of a photo's white background and overlay that new image over another background image. 
 In writing this code we came across some difficulties. One of the most paramount 
 was in writing the chunk of code that would remove the background of the first 
 original photo. We found that when we would run our program our photo would not 
 change even though we felt confident there were no flaws in our code. Essentially, 
 we found that the problem was in switching between jpg and png photos. Although
 we were not able to achieve the results we intially had in mind, we 
 both felt accomplished that after much fustration our code was close to what 
 we wished for.
